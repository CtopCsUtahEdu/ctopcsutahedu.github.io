- Composable High-Level Loop (CHiLL) transformation framework

  CHiLL is a composable high-level loop transformation framework. It supports a wide variety of loop transformations on a whole loop nest or individual sub loop nests inside. Different transformations can be applied in sequence. A scripting interface is also provided and optimizing parameters used by the script can be modified on the fly.
  [CHiLL](https://github.com/CtopCsUtahEdu/chill/archive/v0.3.tar.gz) (ROSE, 2018) release 0.3, Documenation [[CHiLL.pdf](http://ctop.cs.utah.edu/ctop/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CHiLL.pdf)]

  **Archived versions**
  - [CHiLL](http://ctop.cs.utah.edu/downloads/chill.tar.gz) (SUIF, 2011) release 0.2
  - [CHiLL](http://ctop.cs.utah.edu/downloads/chill_rose.tar.gz) (ROSE, 2012), used with [Omega+](http://ctop.cs.utah.edu/downloads/omega_rose.tar.gz)

- [CodeGen+ and Omega+](http://ctop.cs.utah.edu/downloads/omega.tar.gz) release 2.2

  Omega+ is a mathematical library for manipulating integer linear constraints over integer variables in first order logic, and operations on integer sets and their mappings. CodeGen+ is a code generation library by scanning the points in a union of polytopes. A command-line interface to libraries is also included.

- [Documentation](https://github.com/CtopCsUtahEdu/bricklib">Brick Library</a> <a href="https://bricks.run/)

  Bricks is a data layout and code generation framework. It enables performance-portable stencil across Intel CPUs, Intel Knights Landing, Intel GPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs. Math kernel code and data manipulation code are shared across these platforms while achieving best-in-class performance on all platforms simultaneously. Especially, the Brick layout is well suited to higher-order(bigger-wider) stencil computations.
